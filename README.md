I am a recent graduate of UConn's Cyber Security Bootcamp with a passion for working with data, solving problems, and helping others. I plan to continue my education in the field to advance my career and adapt to changes. 

## Objective


My journey in cyber security began in October 2023 when I was accepted into the UConn School of Engineering's Cyber Security Bootcamp, and I am now eager to transition to a career in the field. I'm currently seeking out entry-level analyst and responder roles where I can grow into being a Tier 1 SOC Analyst, and beyond.
